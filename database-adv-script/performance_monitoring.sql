-- Observation:
-- A sequential scan is used on bookings, even though user_id is frequently filtered.
-- No index on property_id in reviews, leading to full table scan.
-- Aggregation is expensive.
-- bookings.property_id is indexed â€” good.
-- Consider materializing this if run frequently.

-- Apply Improvements

-- Adding Missing Index
